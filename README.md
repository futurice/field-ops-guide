# field-ops-guide

_The Field Ops Guide_ is a booklet that makes it possible to survive a software development project. It's a distillation of years of wisdom gathered working in client projects.

Design criteria:
- helps save human lives
- fits your pocket: not too thick, not too rigid (~A6 size)
- combines a guide and a notebook in one, making it multi-purpose
- should contain the most important things, and *only* the most important things
- usable by anyone in a client project
- inexpensive enough to be forgotten lying around rather carelessly

Future ideas:

- [ ] double as a field shovel
- [ ] add a fragrance for that little extra touch (a gentle napalm-lavender mix?)

## How did it happen?

In military and aviation, similar checklists are used to avoid total catastrophes. A few folks from Futurice Tampere office got interested about the idea of doing a similar "field ops guide" that might just be enable a person to work in a challenging software project and live to tell stories about it.

The work started as part of the Tampere Tech Vision Working Group in late 2017, and the first version finally came out of print in late 2018 (phew!)

### Team

The content was compiled and written by [Miro Nieminen](https://github.com/miro), Antti Partanen, [Sakari Hy√∂ty](https://github.com/shyoty) and [Mike Arvela](https://github.com/mieky).

The first pilot print (2018-10) was compiled by Mike and ordered from bookblock.com by Ella Eiranto. Ella also did all the hard design work for getting it to look superb!

Also thanks for the support to Kalle Aaltonen, Kari-Pekka Koljonen, Jari Suksi, Riku Valtasola & Osmo Haapaniemi.

## How to order

These were the specs used to order the booklets from bookblock.com. We did a pilot batch of 150 copies to get initial feedback and feel for the printing quality.
