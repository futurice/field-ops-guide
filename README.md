*The Field Ops Guide* is a booklet that makes it possible to survive a software development project. It's a distillation of years of wisdom gathered working in client projects.

## Design criteria
- helps save human lives
- fits your pocket: not too thick, not too rigid (~A6 size)
- combines a guide and a notebook in one, making it multi-purpose
- should contain the most important things, and *only* the most important things
- usable by anyone in a client project
- inexpensive enough to be forgotten lying around rather carelessly

Future ideas:

- [ ] double as a field shovel
- [ ] add a fragrance for that little extra touch (a gentle napalm-lavender mix?)

## How did it happen?

In military and aviation, similar checklists are used to avoid total catastrophes. A few folks from Futurice Tampere office got interested about the idea of doing a similar "field ops guide" that might just be enable a person to work in a challenging software project and live to tell stories about it.

We decided on a format that asks a number of questions per project phase. One should be able to answer each question with a "yes", or fail to do so only on purpose and with good reasoning.

The work started as part of the Tammerforce Tech Vision Working Group in late 2017, and the first version finally came out of print in late 2018 (phew!)

### Team

The content was compiled and written by [Miro Nieminen](https://github.com/miro), Antti Partanen, [Sakari Hy√∂ty](https://github.com/shyoty) and [Mike Arvela](https://github.com/mieky), with additional ideas and feedback gathered from colleagues.

The first pilot print (2018-10) was compiled by Mike and ordered from bookblock.com by Ella Eiranto. Ella also did all the hard design work for getting it to look superb.

Also thanks for the support to Kalle Aaltonen, Kari-Pekka Koljonen, Jari Suksi, Riku Valtasola & Osmo Haapaniemi and all the others for their valuable input.

## How to order

These were the specs used to order the booklets from bookblock.com. We did a pilot batch of 150 copies to get initial feedback and feel for the printing quality.

Find the contents used in the order in [bookblock-print-2018-10](bookblock-print-2018-10).

For the next order, it might make sense to try a soft cover binding and a thicker 100g paper, which will increase the price a bit. If a rubber band gets added on the cover, the cover elements need to be tweaked accordingly.
