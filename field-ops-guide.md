# Field Ops Guide

## Mission Briefing

_In the beginning of a mission, check all the items on this list, succeed and live to see another adventure. However, if the mission situation gets critical, start eating this guide from the first section towards the last. Just remember to read & comprehend the pages before consuming them._

**Criteria for adding items to this checklist**

* you or someone else has bled or injured because the issue addressed by the checklist question was not taken into account
* you can clearly answer "yes" or "no" to the question - there should be only the most minimum amount of room for interpretation
* you can explain why it is important

**Who is _everyone_?**

You are not alone. Usually there is someone who is paying for the project, internal or external, and typically referred to as the Client. There's someone who is delivering the project and there might be third parties. In this guide everyone means everyone. Use common sense but usually everyone means larger group of people than you might think.

Ok, let's get to the checklist items.

## Sales & Negotiation

### QUESTION: Have the proposal scope & estimates been validated by the experts in that field?

**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

The work estimates presented in the proposal have been validated by someone whose skillset matches with the job.

For example, the amount of design work needed has been checked by an actual designer - preferrably someone whose CV is in the Proposal. The same applies for the implementation estimates & the tech competency.

**Why is this important?**

If experts are not consulted when creating the work estimates, there is a higher risk that the estimates do not reflect the actual needs of the project. When you validate the estimates - or even better, co-create them - with the experts that might actually be working on the project, you lower the risk of creating impossible deadlines or making it difficult for the project to achieve satisfactory results.

### QUESTION: Does everyone understand what are the expected Deliverable(s)?

**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

Everyone understands the difference between _a concept_ created in SVS projects, _a prototype or a proof-of-concept_, and _a launchable MVP_ of the service. Does everyone understand which of these (or some other goal) we are talking about?

**Why is this important?**

If tech people are building a throwaway prototype, everyone else needs to understand that it is not suitable as a baseplate for future development. Skyscrapers are not built on the foundations of sand castles. Everyone needs to have a clear image about the expected capabilities of the deliverable, so that they can plan their future projects and investments accordingly. 

When everyone understands the difference between the types of planned outcomes, they don't get surprised after the project: _"this isn't the thing we bought, what the hell?"_

### QUESTION: Does everyone understand the project contract model?

**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

It is clear for everyone whether the project is _time & material_ or if it is _fixed price & scope_ - or something else.

If the model is _time & material_, does everyone, especially the Client, understand that none of the features are guaranteed simply by the contract?

**Why is this important?**

If this is unclear for either of the sides, you might end up in a difficult situation where the Client demands something from the project team that has not been guaranteed to be delivered in any point of the project. Expectation management!

### QUESTION: Does everyone have a shared assumption of the recognizable major risks in the project?

**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

You have discussed about the major risks in mind that might endanger the project. You have a mutual awareness about the risks - either party is not keeping any of the risks in mind a secret.

**Why is this important?**

You have to map the major risks in order to be prepared for them. When both parties have knowledge about the known risks, their probability of materializing can be reduced more efficiently.

## Beginning of a Project

### QUESTION: Does _everyone_ know why we are doing this project?

**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

Everyone - including project team and **all** the stakeholders in Client organization - knows why this project is done. If you ask anyone they will give you the same answer directly.

Is this project done because of the legislation, or is Client trying to build new business, or what is the reason for doing the project?

**Why is this important?**

When all the people in the project know why we are doing the thing we are doing, everyone is able to make decisions that help push the project to a glorious outcome.

### QUESTION: Have we validated that the problem we are solving is actually worth solving?

**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

* It is proven (not only by the Client) that the end user has the problem we think they have - i.e. _"this is a problem"_.
* We know that solving the problem will resonate with the Client **and** the end users - i.e. _"this is a problem worth solving"_.

**Why is this important?**

One of our strengths is that we critically challenge our clients and their ideas for projects. If it seems that doing this project would not create value for the Client, _we have to have the courage to say no to the money offered_ and to try to find an actual problem worth solving. Doing this will strengthen the Client relationship in the long run.

If the problem is not an actual problem for the end users, doing the project is a total waste. 

If the value of the solution is smaller than the cost of solving it, it does not make sense to allocate time & money to the project. Remember to _Ask why!_

### QUESTION: Does _everyone_ know what is the final deliverable & what it is used for?

**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

Everyone, including all relevant stakeholders in the Client organization, knows the expected delivery and its possibilities for further use. If it is a prototype built quickly with duct tape & WD-40, it is clear for the Client that it will be burned after this project.

**Why is this important?**

If you don't manage the expectations of the Client successfully, you might play them into a difficult position where they have promised the outcome of the project to be used in a way it is not suitable for.

### QUESTION: Does everyone know where project tasks are tracked and how progress is updated?

**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

Everyone knows where to look for the current up-to-date progress of the project. It can be Trello, JIRA, wall in project war room, anything - as long as such thing exists.

Everyone must know what the next & upcoming tasks are, and what is currently in progress. All this information must be found in a single place accessible for everyone.

Everyone knows how the tracking process works and how they can update the status of their tasks so that others can follow the progress.

**Why is this important?**

Good situational awareness is the key element of successful execution. If the task statuses in the project management tool don't match the reality, it leads to false conclusions of the situation.

## Project Execution

Minimum frequency for asking these questions is _every week_.

### QUESTION: Does everyone know possible hard deadlines & why they exist?

**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

Everyone has a shared understanding about deadlines that **must** be met. Emphasis on the word "must" - we have to know what are the actual _hard deadlines_ (such as a big advertisement campaign for the product starting next month) and which of the deadlines are _soft deadlines_ (such as the product owner having a holiday and it'd be nice to have the thing completed before that). What are the consequences of missing the deadline?

**Why is this important?**

Hard deadlines affect how the product owner and the project team should prioritize tasks and raise flags early if need be. It helps to know what things are essential for a successful execution.

### QUESTION: Does everyone know how much time & budget is left?

**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

Everyone knows and has access to information on

  1. how much budget there was in the first place?
  1. how much of it has already been spent and how much is left?

**Why is this important?**

In order to plan your work efficiently and the level of detail where you can operate, you have to know at what point of project you are currently. The Client might get in trouble if the original budget is overrun unexpectedly.

When you know the available budget, you can more easily prioritize what will be done and what will be left out.

### QUESTION: Does the team have a reasoned estimate about amount of work remaining?

**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

Team knows what is required to be delivered for the next milestone, and they have made an estimate of the work required for meeting that milestone.

**Why is this important?**

If the team does not know how much tasks they have and how much work delivering them requires, it is impossible to track the progress towards that milestone.

If you don't know how much work is left, you can't efficiently say no to new requests made by the Client since you don't know how much flexibility you have available on your delivery capability.

It is common for developers to think that _"yeah of course we can deliver this, let's just code harder, should be doable"_, but if as a team you don't have an estimate at all about the remaining work to be done, it can be hard to realize that you actually might already be in trouble and only going deeper. Quite often the Client would happily take no for an answer if that is the reality.

### QUESTION: Does the team continuously write, update and run tests?

**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

  1. Tests are written for new features.
  1. Tests are continuously run - hopefully by automation.
  1. Tests that break on new feature development are retrofitted.
  1. Changing the behaviour of core business logic does break existing tests.

**Why is this important?**

Having tests in place reduces the risk of regression. It also makes onboarding new users easier since they get feedback from the tests in case they break something that was working before they touched the code.

Hardly ever is there budget for writing tests afterwards, nor do the tests help the development at that point, so make appropriate testing part of your standard mode of operation.

### QUESTION: Are the work contributions systematically peer reviewed?

**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

Designs & code are continuously peer reviewed before passing them forward. Everything made in the project goes through at least two pairs of eyes.

**Why is this important?**

Peer reviewing helps spread the knowledge across the team and validates the quality of solutions. It increases the possibility of detecting issues early when it's still cheaper to address them.

### QUESTION: Does the team have a documented plan for the system architecture?

**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

You have a rough documented plan about the architecture of the solution. It is pre-planned, not something that just emerges during the implementation.

**Why is this important?**

Changing the architechture afterwards is _really_ expensive and burdensome. When you plan the architecture beforehand, you can iterate & validate it more easily and more cheaply. Good well-thought architecture makes it easier to reason about solution ideas, much easier to understand how the system works, and it should also make it easier and cheaper to implement new features in the late game. Simplicity, structure, responsibilities.

### QUESTION: Does all the produced code follow the same style conventions?

**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

When you look at the code written in the project you don't know which team member has written it. The coding style and the way to structure code is the same between the developers.

When choosing the code style for the project also look beyond the project itself and preferably pick a style that is framework, platform or language style and follow these standards.

**Why is this important?**

It is easier to understand each others code when the style is identical - you don't have to switch between "style contexts" all the time when browsing the code. It is faster to write new code when you don't have to think about how the code should look like, and it is easier to reason about the style in peer reviews - it's not my style or your style, it's just the well thought style of the code.

### QUESTION: Does everyone have the same situation awareness?

**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

You are not hiding anything from the Client - and vice versa. All unpleasant surprises are shared between both parties.

It is not enough that you have a clear situation presented in the project management tool if everyone is not _actively_ using the tool.

**Why is this important?**

Keeping bad news under the radar harms the project execution. You can't mitigate things you are not aware of. It is always easier to deliver a small piece of bad news early than it is to attempt to hide it only to see it surface later.

Continuously sharing the situation awareness between the Client and the project team creates transparency & an atmosphere where surprises can be flagged easily and escalated further when there is a need to do so.

### QUESTION: Can a new team member get started without help from current project team?

**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

New project member can jump to the team by looking at _written down instructions_ on how to setup the working environment.

**Why is this important?**

If these things have not been written down but are only in the minds of the current project team you have a _bus factor_ problem - if you get too much casualties, hidden knowledge is lost forever, and onboarding new team members becomes painful and expensive.

This is not only a concern of the tech people in the team: are the design assets & materials available in a designated place where new designer can pick them up and start working?

This does not create casualties directly if left undone, but also without the instructions ramping up the project again after a quiet season in the development can be really painful.

## Final Delivery & Ramp-down

Especially in projects where we are delivering a pre-defined scope instead of working as "bandwidth" as part of a Client's project team.

### QUESTION: Is it clear who is in charge of operating the system?

**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

There is a defined person/group of persons who has the responsibility of monitoring the health & status of the system.

There is a contact point to these people if someone else notices something weird in the system.

**Why is this important?**

If no-one is in charge of the system and it happens to go down, we would only have an ad-hoc "hopefully the sales dudette/dude answers their phone" procedure for getting the system back online. Some valuable operation time in production might be lost and end users could get pissed.

### QUESTION: Does someone get automatic notification if something is wrong with the live system?

**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

There are automatic checks in place that notify the persons responsible for monitoring the system if something unexpected happens.

**Why is this important?**

Without automatic checks in place failures could go unnoticed for long periods of time and could cause low service utilization, lost ROI or angry end users who are unable to use the system.

### QUESTION: Are all the running expenses handled by the Client?

**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

When active project development mode is over, all running expenses are handled directly by the Client.

**Why is this important?**

Charges like these might yearly generate thousands of euros worth of expenses that should be handled by the Client directly. Also as credit cards do have an expiration date, when they do expired, the notification of the expiration is not sent to the credit card holder but to the contact point in the account for the service in question. To avoid any easily avoidable downtime in the services, the responsibility of the running costs should be where the direct interest for keeping the service up is - the Client.
