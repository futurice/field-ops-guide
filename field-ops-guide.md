# Field Ops Guide
=================

**Criterias for adding items to this checklist:**

* you or someone else has bled or injured because the issue addressed by the checklist question was not taken into account
* you can clearly answer "yes" or "no" to the question - there should be only the most minimum amount of room for interpretation
* you can explain why it is important



_**In the start of the project check all the items through. If the project situation gets critical, start eating this guide in order of from the first section towards the last. Remember to read & understand the pages before consuming them.**_




## Sales & Negotiation


### QUESTION: Have the scope & estimates been validated by the experts in that field?
**What is the criteria for "yes"?**
The work estimates presented in the proposal are at least validated by someone whose skill set matches the job. 

For example design work amount has been made or at least validated by an actual designer - preferrably someone whose CV is on the Proposal. Same applies for the implementation part & the tech competency.

**Why this is important?**

If the experts are not consulted when creating the work amount estimates, the risk that they don't reflect the actual needs of the project at all rises. When you validate - or even better, co-create - the estimates with the ones who could actually deliver those estimates, you lower the risk of creating impossible deadlines.

### QUESTION: Does the Client understand what are the expected Deliverable(s)?

**What is the criteria for "yes"?**
Client knows a clear difference between a _concept_ created in SVS projects, prototypes or Proof-of-Concepts, and launchable MVP version of the service. Do we know & does the Client understand which of these (or some other goal) we are talking about?

**Why this is important?**

If tech people are building a throwaway prototype, the Client needs to understand that it is not suitable as a baseplate for future development.

Client needs to have clear image about the capabilities of the Deliverable, so they can plan & adjust their future projects accordingly. 

When Client understands these things, they don't get surprised after the project: _"this isn't the thing we bought, what the hell?"_

### QUESTION: Does both, the Client & us, understand the project contract model?

**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

It is clear for both parties that the project is _time & material_ or it is _fixed price & scope_ or something completely else.

If it is _time & material_, does the Client understand that none of the features are guaranteed by the contract?


**Why this is important?**

If this is unclear for either of the sides, you might end up in nasty situations where the Client demands something from the project team that wasn't guaranteed to be delivered in any point of the project. Expectation management!



### QUESTION: Does the team & the Client have a shared assumption on the known major risks in the project?

**What is the criteria for "yes"?**
You have talked about the major recognized risks that might endanger the project. You have a **shared** awareness about them - either party is not keeping any of the recognized risks as a secret.

**Why this is important?**
You have to map the major risks in order to be prepared for them. When both parties have knowledge about the known risks, their probability of materializing can be reduced more efficiently.

## Beginning of Project

### QUESTION: Does _everyone_ know why we are doing this project?

**What is the criteria for "yes"?**
Everyone - including project team and **all** the stakeholders in Client organization - knows why this project is done. If you ask anyone they will give you the same answer directly.

Is this project done because legislation or is Client trying to create new business or what?


**Why this is important?**
When all the people in the project know why we are doing the thing we are doing, everyone is empowered to make decisions themselves which will help pushing the project forward to glorious outcome.

Kick-offs helps to spread this knowledge across the team & stakeholders:

* [LSC: Business Goals & Limitations -canvas](https://leanservicecreation.com/material/p01.pdf)



### QUESTION: Have we validated that the problem we are solving is actually worth solving?


**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

* it is proven (not only by the Client) that the end user has the problem we think they have - ie _"this is a problem"_
* does solving this problem resonate with Client organization AND the end users - ie _"this is a problem worth solving"_


**Why this is important?**

Our offering - and one of our strengths - is that we critically challenge our clients and their ideas for projects. If it seems that doing this project does not create for the customer, _we have to have the courage to say no to the money offered_ and find an actual problem worth solving. Doing this strengthens the Client relationship in the long run. 

If the problem is not an actual problem for end users, doing this project is a total waste. 

If the value of the problem is smaller than the cost of solving it, it does not make sense to allocate time & money for doing the project. Remember to _ask why!_

### QUESTION: Does _everyone_ know what is the final deliverable & what it is used for?

**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

Everyone knows the expected delivery, and its possibilities for further use. If it prototype built quickly with duck tape & WD-40, it is clear for the customer that it will be burned after this project.


**Why this is important?**
If you don't manage the expectations of the Client successfully, you might play them into a nasty spot where they have promised the outcome of the project to be used in a way it is not suitable for.

### QUESTION: Does everyone know where project tasks are tracked?

**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

Everyone in the project team and all the key stakeholders know where to look the current up-to-date progress of the project. It can be Trello, JIRA, wall in project war room, anything - as long as such thing exists.

Everyone must know what are current & upcoming tasks, and what is currently in progress. All this information must be found on a single place accessible for all the people mentioned above.


**Why this is important?**
Good situational awareness is the key element of successful executions.

### QUESTION: Does everyone know how they update their work progress in task management solution?

**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

You can answer "yes" to _"Does everyone know where project tasks are tracked?"_, and everyone knows how your tracking process works - and how they can update status of theirs tasks in it.


**Why this is important?**

Tracking tasks is not _tracking_ if their status does not match the reality.

## Execution (On Project)

Minimum frequency for asking these is _every week_


### QUESTION: Does _everyone_ know possible hard deadlines & why they exist?
**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

Everyone has shared knowledge about deadlines that **must** be met. Emphasis on the word "must" - we have to know what are actually _hard deadlines_ (such as big TV-campaign for the product starting next month) and which are _soft deadlines_ (such as product owner having an holiday and they would like to get this finished before it).


**Why this is important?**

Hard deadlines affects how the project team should prioritize tasks within the project. It helps to know what things are essential for a successful execution.

### QUESTION: Does _everyone_ know how much time & budget is left?
**What is the criteria for "yes"?**
Everyone knows / has access to information on

  1. how much budget there was in the first place
  1. how much of it has already been spent


**Why this is important?**

In order to plan your work efficiently and the level of detail where you can operate, you must know at what point of project you are currently. We normally sell _time & materials_, but the Client still expects to get the solution on the agreed budget. The Client gets in trouble if the original budget is overrun without no good reason why.

When you know the available budget, you can more easily prioritize what will be done and what will be left out.

### QUESTION: Does the team have a reasoned estimate about amount of work remaining?
**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

Team knows what is required to be delivered for their next milestone, and they have made an estimate on the work required for meeting that milestone.

**Why this is important?**

If the team does not know how much tasks they have AND how much work delivering them requires, it is impossible to track the progress towards that milestone.

If you don't know much work is left, you can't efficiently say _"no"_ to new requests made by the Client, since you don't know how much "budget available" you have on your delivery capability.

It is common for developers to think that _"yeah ofcourse we can deliver this, let's just code harder, should be easy features"_, but if as a team you don't have an estimate at all about the remaining work to be done, it can be hard to realize that you actually are already in deep trouble.

### QUESTION: Does the team continuously write, update and run tests?
**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

  1. tests are written for new features
  1. tests are continuously run - hopefully by automation
  1. tests that break on new feature development will be retrofitted
  1. changing the behaviour of core business logic will break existing tests

**Why this is important?**

Having tests in place reduces the change of regression. It also makes onboarding new users easier, since they get feedback from tests in case they break something that was working before they added their new feature / change.

There is usually no budget for writing tests aftewards - so make them part of your standard operating mode.

### QUESTION: Are the contributions continuously peer reviewed?
**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

Designs / codes are continuously peer reviewed before passing them forward. Everything that is made on the project goes through at least one extra eyepair.


**Why this is important?**

Helps to spread knowledge across the team and validates the solutions done. Increases the possibility of detecting errors early on - and therefore it is cheaper to address them.

### QUESTION: Does the team have a written plan for the system architechture?
**What is the criteria for "yes"?**
You have a rough documented plan about the architechture your team is going to build. It is pre-planned, not something that emerges during the implementation.


**Why this is important?**
Changing the architechture aftewards is really expensive. When you plan it before implementing, you can iterate & validate it more easily and more cheaply.


**Relevant links:**


### QUESTION: Does the code look the same no matter who has written it?
**What is the criteria for "yes"?**
When you look at the code of the project you don't know which team member has written it. The coding style is identical between every developer

**Why this is important?**

It is easier to understand each others code when the style is identical - you don't have to reload the "style context" every time you switch between a code snippet of different developer. It is faster to write new code when you don't have to think about how the code should look like.

Use automatic tools for linting or/and formatting the code to the format decided mutually by the project team.




### QUESTION: Does the Client & Project Team have the same situation awareness?
**What is the criteria for "yes"?**
You are not hiding anything from the Client - and vice versa. All the unpleasant surprises are shared between both parties.


**Why this is important?**
Keeping bad news under the radar harms the project execution. You can't mitigate things you are not aware of.

Continuously sharing the situation awareness between the Client and the Project Team creates atmosphere where surprises can be flagged easily and escalated further when there is a need for it.

It is always easier to deliver the bad news earlier than later.



### QUESTION: Can new team member get started without help from current project team?
**What is the criteria for "yes"?**
New project member can jump to the team by looking at _written down instructions_ on how to setup working environment.


**Why this is important?**

If these things are not written down but are only in the minds of the current project team you have a _bus factor problem_ - if you get too much casualties, hidden knowledge is lost forever, and onboarding new team members gets painful.

This does not concern only the tech people of the team. Are the design assets & materials available in some designated place where new designer can pick them up?

This does not create casualties directly if left undone, but without this ramping the project up again can be really painful. See <the documentation question in ramp-down>



## Final Delivery & Ramp-down
...in projects where we are delivering some pre-defined scope - instead of "bandwidth" to Client's project team


### QUESTION: Is it clear who is in charge of operating the system?
**What is the criteria for "yes"?**

There is a defined person / group of persons who has responsibility of monitoring the health & status of the system.

There is a contact point where these people answer if someone else notices something funky on the system.


**Why this is important?**

If no-one is in charge of the system, it could go down completely and we would have only an ad-hoc "hopefully the Futurice Sales Dudette/Dude answers their phone" procedure for re-starting it



### QUESTION: Does someone get automatic notification if something is wrong with the live system?
**What is the criteria for "yes"?**
There are automatic checks in place which notifies the persons responsible for monitoring the system if something unexpected happens.

**Why this is important?**
Without this in place the failures could go unnoticed for long periods of time - and you finally would get angry phone calls from the end users who are unable to use the system anymore



### QUESTION: Are all the running expenses transferred to Client?
**What is the criteria for "yes"?**
When active project mode is over, no charges of the services used are billed from Futurice credit cards anymore.

**Why this is important?**

Unnoticed charges like these generates yearly expenses worth thousands of euros that should be billed from the customer. If the credit card which these are billed from is invalidated, some essential system might get accidentally suspended.
